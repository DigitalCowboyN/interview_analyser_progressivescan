      [INSTRUCTION]
      You are an expert transcript analyzer specializing in the classification of conversational content. Your task is to analyze a single sentence extracted from an interview transcript without any additional context, and assign a concise topic label that best captures its main subject. Additionally, you must provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Input Sentence:** The sentence to be classified is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Context:** None (an empty context is provided).
      - **Output:** Your answer should consist of the topic label enclosed in angle brackets followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing Strategy> [0.95]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Input Sentence: "I believe our current marketing strategy needs an overhaul."
      Context: []
      Output: <Marketing Strategy> [0.95]

      [TASK]
      For the given input, analyze the content carefully and return only the topic label in the specified format.

      [INSTRUCTION]
      You are an expert transcript analyst specializing in the classification of conversational content. Your task is to analyze a single sentence extracted from an interview transcript while considering additional context provided as numerical embedding values. Assign a concise topic label that best captures its main subject, and provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Input Sentence:** The sentence to be classified is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Context:** Additional context is provided as a list of numerical values representing an enriched embedding.
      - **Output:** Your answer should consist of the topic label enclosed in angle brackets followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing Strategy> [0.92]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Input Sentence: "I believe our current marketing strategy needs an overhaul."
      Context: [0.1234, 0.5678, 0.9101, ...]
      Output: <Marketing Strategy> [0.92]

      [TASK]
      For the given input, analyze the content carefully while taking into account the numerical context, and return only the topic label in the specified format.
    confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Threshold above which to trust local classification
    context_aggregation_method: "neighboring_sentences"  # Options: "embedding", "neighboring_sentences", "summary"

      [INSTRUCTION]
      You are a seasoned transcript analyst specializing in thematic clustering. Your task is to review an aggregated summary representing a cluster of sentences from an interview transcript. Based on this summary, determine a single, overarching thematic label that best encapsulates the common subject matter of the cluster. Additionally, provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Cluster Summary:** The summary is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Output:** Your response should be a single, succinct thematic label enclosed in angle brackets, followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing & Customer Engagement> [0.93]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Cluster Summary: "Discussions cover new marketing strategies, challenges in customer engagement, and innovative ideas for digital campaigns."
      Output: <Marketing & Customer Engagement> [0.93]

      [TASK]
      Analyze the provided cluster summary carefully and return only the thematic label in the specified format.
    confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Threshold above which to trust local classification
    context_aggregation_method: "representative_sentences"  # Options: representative_sentences, summary, embedding
    summary_sentence_count: 3  # Number of sentences to include in the summary
  final:
    final_weight_local: 0.6    # Weight for local classification output in conflict resolution
    final_weight_global: 0.4   # Weight for global classification output in conflict resolution

  data_dir: "data/interviews"  # Directory where transcript files are stored
  logs_dir: "logs"             # Directory for log files
  output_dir: "output"         # Directory to store intermediate and final outputs

# Additional parameters for future enhancements (e.g., fine-tuning, API endpoints, etc.)
additional:
  use_weighted_context: true   # Whether to use weighted averaging for context embeddings
  visualize_embeddings: false  # Whether to generate embedding visualizations. Allows for visual inspection of relationhsip, clusters, and overal structure (e.g., PCA/t-SNE)
