      [INSTRUCTION]
      You are an expert transcript analyzer specializing in the classification of conversational content. Your task is to analyze a single sentence extracted from an interview transcript without any additional context, and assign a concise topic label that best captures its main subject. Additionally, you must provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Input Sentence:** The sentence to be classified is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Context:** None (an empty context is provided).
      - **Output:** Your answer should consist of the topic label enclosed in angle brackets followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing Strategy> [0.95]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Input Sentence: "I believe our current marketing strategy needs an overhaul."
      Context: []
      Output: <Marketing Strategy> [0.95]

      [TASK]
      For the given input, analyze the content carefully and return only the topic label in the specified format.

      You are an expert transcript analyst specializing in the classification of conversational content. Your task is to analyze a single sentence extracted from an interview transcript while considering additional context provided as numerical embedding values. Assign a concise topic label that best captures its main subject, and provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Input Sentence:** The sentence to be classified is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Context:** Additional context is provided as a list of numerical values representing an enriched embedding.
      - **Output:** Your answer should consist of the topic label enclosed in angle brackets followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing Strategy> [0.92]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Input Sentence: "I believe our current marketing strategy needs an overhaul."
      Context: [0.1234, 0.5678, 0.9101, ...]
      Output: <Marketing Strategy> [0.92]

      [TASK]
      For the given input, analyze the content carefully while taking into account the numerical context, and return only the topic label in the specified format.
    confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Threshold above which to trust local classification
    context_aggregation_method: "neighboring_sentences"  # Options: "embedding", "neighboring_sentences", "summary"
    context_window: 1  # Number of neighboring sentences to include (if applicable)

      You are a seasoned transcript analyst specializing in thematic clustering. Your task is to review an aggregated summary representing a cluster of sentences from an interview transcript. Based on this summary, determine a single, overarching thematic label that best encapsulates the common subject matter of the cluster. Additionally, provide a confidence score for your classification.

      [FORMAT]
      - **Cluster Summary:** The summary is provided within double quotation marks.
      - **Output:** Your response should be a single, succinct thematic label enclosed in angle brackets, followed immediately by a numerical confidence score in square brackets. For example:
        <Marketing & Customer Engagement> [0.93]
      - Do not include any extra commentary or explanation.

      [EXAMPLE]
      Cluster Summary: "Discussions cover new marketing strategies, challenges in customer engagement, and innovative ideas for digital campaigns."
      Output: <Marketing & Customer Engagement> [0.93]

      [TASK]
      Analyze the provided cluster summary carefully and return only the thematic label in the specified format.
    confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Threshold above which to trust local classification
    context_aggregation_method: "representative_sentences"  # Options: representative_sentences, summary, embedding
    summary_sentence_count: 3  # Number of sentences to include in the summary
  final:
    final_weight_local: 0.6    # Weight for local classification output in conflict resolution
    final_weight_global: 0.4   # Weight for global classification output in conflict resolution

paths:
  data_dir: "data/interviews"  # Directory where transcript files are stored
  logs_dir: "logs"             # Directory for log files
  output_dir: "output"         # Directory to store intermediate and final outputs

docker:
  base_image: "ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light"
  python_version: "3.10"       # Python version used in the Docker container

# Additional parameters for future enhancements (e.g., fine-tuning, API endpoints, etc.)
additional:
  use_weighted_context: true   # Whether to use weighted averaging for context embeddings
  visualize_embeddings: false  # Whether to generate embedding visualizations. Allows for visual inspection of relationhsip, clusters, and overal structure (e.g., PCA/t-SNE)
